Other symptoms include sleep problems, problems thinking/remembering, headaches, dizziness and heart palpitations. As you can imagine, these symptoms have a severe impact on a person's life and often lead to a sudden or extreme change in lifestyle (eg, time outside, time in bed, time seeing friends, etc)",
